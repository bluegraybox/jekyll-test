# Jekyll Test

This is a test Jekyll site.
It was created using `jekyll new` and adding the auto-generated github deployment config.
That didn't work out of the box, and significant debugging was required to get it going, mostly because of various Ruby gem conflicts.

Run `make init` to install all the gem dependencies.

Run `make` to start the Jekyll web server.
